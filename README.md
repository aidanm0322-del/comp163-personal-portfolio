Assignment 4 
•	What your game is about (your creative theme)
My game takes a person's previous GPA and lets them choose a class for the next semester, and sets the levels with hard, medium, and easy. It then allows them, based on their GPA at the end of the semester, to determine if they had a great year, a good year or an ok year. 

•	Which branching concepts are demonstrated where
The branching topics that I used were comparison operators. Then I used those in step 2 of the code, and then I used membership and logical operators in step 3 and 4 of the code.

•	How to run the game
You run the game by putting it in an IDE and choosing the path that you would like to take. So you can do 18 credit hours, and then you would study a little bit for certain subjects, and depending on how long you study, it determines if your social life, stress levels, and GPA go up or down.

•	What do the different endings represent
The different endings represent if you finished the game with a perfect 4.0 GPA, a GPA between 3.5 - 4.0, and then 2.5 and above

•	Any AI assistance used during development
Yes, I used AI to debug my code, and I asked it to clarify some of the directions that were written in the requirements. 

Assignment 5 Loop design documentation

•	Why did you choose each loop type for each challenge

First challenge, I chose a while loop because I wanted it to print the number sequence until it got to one. For the second challenge, I chose a for loop because I wanted everything in the range from 2 to n, and once it determined if the number was even, I wanted it to stop the whole loop and print that the number is prime. For challenge 3, I chose a nested loop because it goes through all the columns and for every row without having to write a singular line for each column. 

•	How your solutions work

My solution work by the first challenge will continue to print out numbers until they get to 1, which will terminate the loop. The second solution works because it checks to see if a prime number is divisible by one, but if the break statement isn't used, the else statement will be printed. The third challenge works by creating a row-by-row and column-by-column approach instead of manually printing all those ranges for the multiplication challenge.  

•	Any AI assistance used

I used AI to help me debug the code when certain parts weren't working, like when my 17 was printing, it was not prim,e but it is indeed a prime number. I also had AI break down to me how to use the print("", end="") statement. 


Assignment 6 
This is a program that takes contact information that is inputted of any type of way and converts and outputs it in a certian way that makes eveything alined and look neat.
