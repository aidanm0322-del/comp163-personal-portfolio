•	What your game is about (your creative theme)
My game takes a person's previous GPA and lets them choose a class for the next semester, and sets the levels with hard, medium, and easy. It then allows them, based on their GPA at the end of the semester, to determine if they had a great year, a good year or an ok year. 

•	Which branching concepts are demonstrated where
The branching topics that I used were comparison operators. Then I used those in step 2 of the code, and then I used membership and logical operators in step 3 and 4 of the code.
•	How to run the game
You run the game by putting it in an IDE and choosing the path that you would like to take. So you can do 18 credit hours, and then you would study a little bit for certain subjects, and depending on how long you study, it determines if your social life, stress levels, and GPA goes up or down.
•	What do the different endings represent
The different endings represent if you finished the game with a perfect 4.0 GPA a GPA between 3.5 - 4.0, and then 2.5 and above
•	Any AI assistance used during development
Yes i used Ai to debug my code and I asked it to clarify some of the directions that where written in the requirements.
